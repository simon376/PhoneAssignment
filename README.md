# PhoneAssignment
Software Design Patterns Assignment MVC

Assignment created for "Software Design Patterns" class implementing the Model-View-Controller pattern,
as well as using the Observer, State and Singleton Patterns.

The application creates a simple phone which can be used to send text messages or make phone calls.
Two different views may be used, an "Oldschool" UI using only a number pad 
or an modern UI using a fullsized QWERTY keyboard as it can be found on current smartphones.
Both views use their respective controllers to modify the underlying model which is of course shared by both views.
